Please support the original authors if you can, if you wish to help me out then yo may donate to 1BCspL7f75gcU17M62524KSnfh7tyy3ZnF.\r\n\r\nMuch of the styling is done in css, specifically the bootstrap-responsive.css, menu styling is done in component.css.\r\n\r\nMuch of the data is taken from json and leverages jquery. \r\n\r\nHow to get it working on your node:\r\n\r\nStep 1. copy the code to the root web folder of your hosting platform or to the web-static folder of p2pool\r\nStep 2. rename anything in \"d3.json('http://au.norgzpool.net.au:9332\" to your node address. Do this in the index.html graphs.html and stats.html\r\nStep 3. load your own logo for the header. make it 711x150 pixels or as close to that as you can. it can be jpg, png or gif and you change it in the header div of the index and other pages (the dreamweaver template is included if you want to use that so you only change in the index and template)\r\nStep 4. browse and enjoy p2pool stats in a nice interface and using standard port 80\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry in advance if somethign is not clear, I am not a developer, I just know enough to piece things together. Happy to assist if required. \r\n\r\nNote: If i have missed crediting anyone or there is something here you do not wish to be redistributed please accept my appology and contact me to have it removed immediately. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
